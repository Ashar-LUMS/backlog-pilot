# Backlog Pilot

Backlog Pilot is a lightweight Trello-style backlog manager with four swimlanes (Backlog, In Progress, Review, Done). Each project is protected by a secret key: share the key with collaborators and they can immediately open the board. No traditional account system is required.

## ‚ú® Features

- Create projects with custom secret keys and share them securely.
- Four standard delivery columns with drag-and-drop card movement.
- Rich card management with descriptions, inline editing, and deletion.
- Secret key gatekeeping on every API call (provided via `x-project-secret`).
- Shareable invite links that prefill the project ID so teammates only supply the secret.
- JSON file persistence ‚Äî no external database required.
- Automated server tests covering project access, backlog CRUD, and reordering.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 20+
- npm 10+

### Install dependencies

```powershell
cd server
npm install
cd ..\client
npm install
```

### Configure environment (optional)

The client automatically talks to `http://localhost:5000/api`. To point at a different backend, copy `.env.example` and update the URL:

```powershell
cd client
Copy-Item .env.example .env
# edit .env to set VITE_API_BASE
```

### Run the app locally

Open two terminals:

1. **API server**
   ```powershell
   cd server
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Frontend**
   ```powershell
   cd client
   npm run dev
   ```

Visit `http://localhost:5173` and enter a project secret to open a board, or create a new project.

## ‚úÖ Quality Gates

- **Server tests**
  ```powershell
  cd server
  npm test
  ```
- **Frontend build**
  ```powershell
  cd client
  npm run build
  ```

Both gates are green as of the latest commit.
